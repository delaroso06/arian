            and he plans to become the best player in Japan.<br> I don’t care about much else, and I don’t waste my time with distractions. I’m aiming for the NBA, and I won’t <br> let anything stand in my way. If you want to challenge me on the court,
            be ready to lose. Now, step aside."</h3>
